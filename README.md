# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets
This project has been done as an imperative part of my internship at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2020).

## Objective
To Develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that will allow to do polarity classification of tweets. 

## Authors
* Divya Gladys G

## A breif description of the project
This project has been done in participation with a [kaggle InClass competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-of-tweets). We have extracted the nature of the opinions to classify the given set of tweets based on their polarity as positive, negative or neutral. We have attempted to develop a number of skills such as – various techniques for pre-processing text, and for text vectorization using feature extraction. I have also compared the adequacy of various statistical models such as Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines for text classification.

For further details about the Exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing phase, word-embedding techniques, various machine learning algorithms used and the results of the models, refer to the project report.
